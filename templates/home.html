    <h1>Welcome To BoulderView</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Purpose:</h2>
      <p>In conjunction with the City of Boulder, I wanted to be able to identify the popular photo spots. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Data:</h2>
      <p>All data was collected from Twitter using its API. I'm able to pull data roughly once every hour, and append it to my dataframe.
      So far I've pulled roughly 800 unique Tweets. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Challenges:</h2>
      <p>Working with a small dataset has its ups and downs. It's easy to manipulate, but it's difficult to get accurate results.
